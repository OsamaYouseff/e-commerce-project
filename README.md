# EVO MARKET

## Overview

EVO MARKET is a full-featured E-commerce platform built with modern web technologies, offering a seamless online shopping experience. This project is a full-stack application developed using ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS (ExpressJS) for the backend. MongoDB serves as the database, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for managing products, orders, users, and other essential data.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

-   **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring the content on the web pages.
-   **CSS3**: Stylesheet language used for designing the appearance of the website, ensuring it is responsive and visually appealing.
-   **JavaScript ES6**: Core programming language used for adding interactivity to the website, making it dynamic and user-friendly.
-   **ReactJS**: A powerful JavaScript library used for building the user interface, enabling a fast, responsive, and modular frontend experience.
-   **Material UI**: A popular React UI framework used to create consistent and aesthetic components, ensuring a smooth user experience.
-   **Framer Motion**: A library used to add animations to the UI components, enhancing the visual appeal and user engagement.
-   **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests to the backend, handling data exchange between the frontend and backend efficiently.
-   **ReduxJS**: A state management library that helps manage the application's global state, ensuring a consistent and predictable data flow.
-   **Redux Toolkit**: An advanced toolset that simplifies the process of writing Redux logic, making state management more efficient and less error-prone.
-   **JS-cookie**: A lightweight JavaScript API for handling cookies, used for managing user sessions and other data stored in cookies.
-   **React-hot-toast**: A notification library used to provide users with instant feedback through toasts for actions like adding items to the cart or completing a purchase.
-   **React-router-dom**: A routing library that allows for seamless navigation within the React application, enabling a single-page application experience.

### Backend

-   **NodeJS**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for building the server-side of the application.
-   **ExpressJS**: A fast and minimalist web framework for NodeJS, used for setting up the backend server and handling API routes.
-   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing data, providing high performance and scalability for the application.
-   **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, used for managing data relationships, validating data, and defining schema models.
-   **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims transferred between two parties, used for secure authentication and authorization.
-   **bcrypt**: A password-hashing function used for securely storing user passwords in the database, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.
-   **cors**: A middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend and backend to communicate securely across different origins.
-   **crypto**: A module providing cryptographic functionalities, used for encrypting sensitive data, ensuring data integrity and security.
-   **dotenv**: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file, allowing for secure configuration management across different environments.
-   **Nodemon**: A development tool that automatically restarts the NodeJS server upon detecting changes in the codebase, improving development efficiency.

### Tools

-   **JSON**: A lightweight data-interchange format used for exchanging data between the frontend and backend.
-   **Postman**: A popular API development tool used for testing API endpoints, ensuring the backend services are functioning as expected.

## Key Features

-   **User Authentication & Authorization**: EVO MARKET implements secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for password encryption.
-   **Product Management**: The platform allows administrators to add, update, and delete products, managing the entire product catalog.
